## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the Base. The Base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. 25mm wide center hole.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4) To be honest,I don't feel that I learned any new things. On the otherhand I feel basic familarty and sense of fuidity increase (short cut keys)
Onshape is really nice and renaming sketches is very helpful.

## Mount

### Description

The Second part is a mount to attach to the base for the next part. The dimensions are 100mm x 100mm and 8mm thick. There are 4 10mm wide holes 20mm from edge in each corner and a 25mm wide center hole

### Reflection

This part was very similar the part prior and took little time. While creating the first extrude selecting *new* will make it as whole new part in the same Onshape document. I almost missed this and it would have caused furture problems for me.

## Fork

### Description

The third part is a Fork to be attched to the mount and hold the wheel. The Main Circle is 80mm and 8mm thick. The Arms are and 40mm by 5 mm rectangle 15 mm from the origin extruded 75 mm. 15mm fillets on top edges of arms extrude. 1mm fillets on edges of prior fillet. 5mm fillet on bottom edged of Arms extrude. Arm is mirrored over Front Plane. 10mm hole 15mm from top of arm through all. Pole is made by a 20mm and a 5mm circle on other side of the Main Circle concentric to origin,then extruded. Champfer Main circle edges and top edge of Pole by 1mm.

### Reflection

First uses of Fillet (shift-f), Champfer (None), and mirror (none). I had to rename Extrudes to refer to in description.

## Tire

### Description

The forth part is a Tire that will be attached to the Rim which will be attached to the Fork. The dimmensions of the Wheel sketch is a trapazoid with a 20mm bottom side with 10 degree sides from the verticle construction line. The inner open space of the wheel is 80mm meanwile the compleate diameteret edged to edge is 110 mm. Revolve the Wheel sketch to creat the wheel. Fillet top outer edged of Wheel revolve 8 mm.

### Reflection

This part is fairly simple yet intoduces some important information to learn. This is first use of the Revolve tool (none) and  [in Dr. Sheilds video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=181&v=ReEGioIYSus&feature=emb_title) he explains when creating demensions that going oover the center line will change the dimesion value from radisu to diameter.

## Wheel

### Description

This part is what the tire will go around and will be attahced to the Fork. The Wheel sketch for the main revolve looks like this <img src="https://github.com/lmcmind85/BasicCAD/blob/master/Images/Screenshot%202020-10-13%20at%2011.01.46%20AM.png?raw=true" width="125"> (10mm inner diameter and 80mm outer diameter) and is symetric with the origin and the outer verticle lines are conceentric. Revolving this sketch over the horizantle consruction line will give you the basis of the Wheel. To create the spokes create a sketch on the face of Wheel Revolve and cut highlighted area. <img src="https://github.com/lmcmind85/BasicCAD/blob/master/Images/Screenshot%202020-10-13%20at%2011.39.52%20AM.png?raw=true" width="125">  Add a 2 mm fillet on the 4 inner edges of Spoke extrude. Create a circular feture patern of the spoke and prior fillet on the the face of Wheel revolve with 5 repetitions. Add 1 mm fillet to either side of on the face of Wheel revolve.

### Reflection

This part was similar to the last part with some more steps and details. Having a "multi-shape" sketch to revolve and was hepful understand the more possibilities with this feature.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

The Axle is a 60mm long hollow pipe with an outer diameter of 10mm and inner diameter of 6mm. There is a 10mm deep cut in the axle 4.5mm above the origin on the face of Axle extrude. Reflect the cut to other side of the Axle.

The collar is a 10mm long cylinder that has an outer diameter of 15 mm and and an inner diameter of 10mm with a 3mm hole on the middle of the side.

The bearing is a 5mm long cylinder with an inner diameter of 10mm and an outer diameter of 25mm.

The big bearing is 5mma long cylinder with an inner diameter of 20mm and an outer diameter of 30mm

### Reflection

All of these parts are fairly simple and quick. They are important for the assembly of the Castetr.

## Wheel/Tire/Bearing,Axle,Sub-Assembly

### Description

This is a sub-assembly of the the Wheel, Tire, Bearing, and Axle. Use a fasten mate to mate the origin to the origin to the Wheel. Same with the tire. Use a revolute mate to mate the origin to the origin of the Axle. Use a revolve mate to the outer origin of the bearing to the outer origin of the Wheel. There should be one Bearing on either side.

### Reflection

This sub-assembly will make our final assmebky easier and it reflects how a caster wwould be assemble in real life. Due to having many multi-part studios finding all the parts to put in the assembly is easier.

## CasterAssembly

### Description

This is the full Caster Assembly. Use the fasten mate to mate the origin to the origin of the Base. Use the fasten mate to mate the an outer origin of the Base to an outer origin of the Mount. Use the revolute mate to mate the an outer origin of the Big Bearing to an outer origin of the Mount. Use the revolute mate to mate the the outer origin of the Big Bearing to the origin of the Base plate on the Fork. Use a revolute mate to mate the inner edge o the fork to the outer edge of the Bearing connected to the Wheel/Tire/Bearing,Axle,Sub-Assembly. Use a revelute mate to mate the outer edge of the Collar to the outer edge of the Fork around the Axle. There should be one on either side. Use a pararell mate to mate the flat edge of the axle to the hole in the Collar on both sides. Add Hex Socket Head Cap (reference images for mesurments) to the 4 holes on the Base/Mount. Add Hex Nuts (reference images for mesurments) to the underside of the 4 holes on the Base/Mount. Add a Hex Thin Nut (reference image for mesurements) to the top middle hole around the Fork pole. Add pins to the holes on the collar (reference image for mesurements. Offset the Z direction of the pin by 3mm.
