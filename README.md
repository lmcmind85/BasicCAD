## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. 25mm wide center hole.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The Second part is a mount for the following part. The dimensions are 100mm x 100mm and 8mm thick. There are 4 10mm wide holes 20mm from edge in each cornet and a  25mm wide center hole

### Reflection

This wasn't very hard and it was very similar the part prior. While creating the first extrude selecting *new* makes it a whole new part in the same document. I almost missed this and it would have caused furture problems for me

# Caster

## Base

The base was pretty simple and easy. I almost missed the last step of adding the 25mm hole on the origin and noticed a few others have as well.

## Mount

Linear patterns are usefull for the holes. I had to take extra time to make this part a new part through selecting *new* in the first extrude.
